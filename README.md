# Data Curation and Analysis
**Project goal:** My goal for this project was to create a dataframe for the top 200 highest grossing movies of all time, and use this dataframe to create descriptive statistics and visualizations of the data.

**License:** MIT License

**Source:** All project data comes directly from this website: https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW

**Data Type:** The data is made entirely of strings (movie title), integers (rank and year released), and floats (lifetime gross in USD).

**Potential Bias:** The lifetime gross figure does not necessarily account for factors like the actual profit the movie made or the budget of the movie, which both heavily influence total box office figures for a movie. The data also skews heavily towards American film, which could suggest some bias towards American film and media, as some might believe this means the US is the best at making films, when in reality this boils down to many more factors such as resources and media influence. Another source of bias is that the highest grossing films are heavily skewed towards more modern movies, since the older lifetime gross figures are not adjusted for inflation.

**Analysis:** The data is a full spreadsheet of the lifetime gross of the 200 highest grossing films in history.
