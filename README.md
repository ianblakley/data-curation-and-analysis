# Data Curation and Analysis
**Project goal:** My goal for this project was to create a dataframe for the top 200 highest grossing movies of all time, and use this dataframe to create descriptive statistics and visualizations of the data.

**Source:** All project data comes directly from this website: https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW

**Data Type:** The data is made entirely of strings (movie title), integers (rank and year released), and floats (lifetime gross in USD).

**Potential Bias:** The lifetime gross figure does not necessarily account for factors like the actual profit the movie made or the budget of the movie, which both heavily influence total box office figures for a movie. The data also skews heavily towards American film, which could suggest some bias towards American film and media, as some might believe this means the US is the best at making films, when in reality this boils down to many more factors such as resources and media influence. Another source of bias is that the highest grossing films are heavily skewed towards more modern movies, since the older lifetime gross figures are not adjusted for inflation.

**Analysis:** The data is a full spreadsheet of the lifetime gross of the 200 highest grossing films in history. The visualization I created was the lifetime gross for each film in the dataframe by the year it was released. The general trend of the data was pretty unsurprising to me as I was already aware of some of the highest grossing films of all time and the years they were released, however, it was pretty surprising to me that a film from 1977, Star Wars: A New Hope, would show up on this list that seems to be dominated by movies released from 2000 to present. For context, the next oldest film on the list was released a full five years later, in 1982. This brings me to the next thing about this dataframe I was surpised by, which was the sheer domination of 21st century movies on this list. While I knew these movies would be at the top of the list, I was unaware to the degree of how much of the list they would take up. Out of the 200 movies on the list, only 11 were released before 2000, which is a meager 5.5% of movies on the list.
